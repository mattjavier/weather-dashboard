# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard application that utilizes a third-part API, the OpenWeather API, to display weather conditions for cities. HTML and CSS elements are dynamically updated when cities are searched. The application allows users to:

* Search cities using a search bar to recieve information on a city's weather conditions.

* The city's name, the date, an icon representing the weather, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index are displayed to the user.

* If the UV index's conditions are favorable (less than 4), then it will be highlighted in green. If the conditions are moderate (4-7), then it will be highlighted in yellow. If the UV index's conditions are severe (greater than 7), then it will be highlighted in red.

* The city's 5-day forecast is also shown below, with the date, an icon, the temperature, and the humidity for each day.

* Searching a city provides the user with a search history. The search history is a list of buttons the user can click on to view previously searched weather conditions.

* Upon opening the weather dashboard, or upon refreshing the page, the search history will be displayed, along with the weather conditions for the most recently searched city.
